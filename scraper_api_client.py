bbb-scraper — 2captcha Scraper API edition (fourth engine)
==========================================================

A fourth way to run this scraper. Unlike playwright_scraper.py /
puppeteer_scraper.py / selenium_scraper.py, this one manages **no browser and
no CDP session of its own**: it POSTs a URL to 2captcha's separate **Scraper
API** (https://scraper.2captcha.com — a different product from the Scraping
Browser API the other three reach through --cdp-endpoint), gets HTML back over
plain HTTPS, and feeds it to this project's product_parser.

Why you would want it: no Chromium to install, no CDP plumbing, runs from a
tiny container or a lambda.

WHAT THIS SITE NEEDS — READ THIS FIRST
--------------------------------------
On BBB this client is for **`--mode profile`**, and it is a genuinely good
fit for it: a profile is ONE page, server-rendered, with everything in the
first response. No scrolling, nothing to wait for — exactly the shape a
browserless fetch handles well.

It is NOT the way to read a listing, and that is not a limitation of this
client. BBB's own `/api/search` endpoint answers an ordinary HTTPS request
with no key, no proxy and no browser (measured 2026-09-16: HTTP 200, 57 KB,
from a datacenter address). Paying for a rendered page to get data that is
already free is a waste, so if you want listings, use one of the three
browser engines — or just call the endpoint.

`--cdp-url` is REQUIRED here, and that is measured rather than assumed.
2026-09-16, the same profile URL:

    plain                     upstream 403, 12,889 bytes — Cloudflare's hard
                              block. The Scraper API's own exits are
                              datacenter addresses and BBB refuses them.
    routed --cdp-url through  upstream 200, 113,389 bytes, profile parsed in
    a Scraping Browser        full: name, A+, accreditation date, complaint
                              totals.

So the two 2Captcha products are used TOGETHER here: the Scraper API for the
fetch-and-parse, the Scraping Browser for the exit. Without the second, this
path reaches nothing on bbb.org.

Usage
-----
    # routed through a Scraping Browser API session, which is what makes it
    # reach the site at all
    python3 scraper_api_client.py --mode profile \
        --url "https://www.bbb.org/us/ny/bronx/profile/cleaning-services/proclean-maintenance-systems-inc-0121-134716" \
        --cdp-url "ws://user:pass@cb.2captcha.com:9222" --timeout 90

    # the key comes from $TWOCAPTCHA_KEY and the endpoint from
    # $BBB_CDP_ENDPOINT, so neither needs to be typed — a secret in
    # argv is readable by anything that can run `ps`

Requires: pip install -r requirements.txt
          (no playwright/selenium/pyppeteer needed for this engine)
