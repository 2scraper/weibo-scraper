captcha_solver.py
------------------
Shared helper used by all three scrapers (Playwright / Selenium / Puppeteer).

Detection runs after EVERY page navigation in the main loop of all three
scrapers, regardless of what URL was requested (category hub, product page,
sign-in, checkout, anything) — this is deliberate, not scoped to any one
page. If BBB renders a reCAPTCHA challenge anywhere — account, sign-in and
review-submission flows are the usual places — this fires.

**BBB's own gate is Cloudflare Turnstile, not reCAPTCHA.** Measured
2026-09-16: a Managed Challenge carries `cf_chl_opt` and a Turnstile widget,
and the pages this scraper reads carry no reCAPTCHA at all rather than
an interstitial. So this module is a contingency, not part of the happy path
— a bot manager can be switched on between deploys, and a scraper that
cannot name what stopped it is much harder to fix.

Detection therefore stays BROAD (which challenge a visitor meets depends on
the exit and on what the address has been doing) while spending stays
NARROW: `--solve-captcha when-blocked` is the default and counts product
links before paying, `page_flow.SOLVES_PER_PAGE` caps a page at one
purchase, and `page_flow.STATE_POLICY` — not this file — decides which state
is worth money at all.

There is deliberately no DataDome path here. See "No DataDome solver" below.

Flow:
  1. Both detectors run and are reconciled (see reconcile_detections) to decide
     the variant: v3, v2-invisible or v2-checkbox. The parameters differ per
     variant and are not interchangeable — v3 params sent for a v2-invisible
     widget buy a token the site rejects.
  2. The challenge goes to 2captcha's API (v2 by default, legacy v1 as a
     one-shot fallback) with the parameters for that variant.
  3. The resulting token is injected into the page's `g-recaptcha-response`
     textarea and any bound callback is invoked.

Often none of this is needed. Over the Scraping Browser API,
`Captcha.setAutoSolve` can clear the challenge inside the browser before this
code gets a turn — treat `Captcha.solveFinished` as the success signal and keep
this path as the fallback rather than assuming every detection completes.
This module is the path for a browser you launched yourself.

No other captcha vendor is integrated (per spec: no competitors).

# longer matched the sibling farfetch-scraper repo's target)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# What changed there: the sign-up modal used to render
#   <captcha-widget data-version="v3" data-sitekey="6Leif..." ...>
# with the whole config in HTML attributes. Verified live on 2026-08-24, that
# element is GONE. The modal now loads
#   https://recaptcha.net/recaptcha/api.js?render=explicit
# and configures the widget entirely in JavaScript, into a
#   <div id="register-captcha" class="g-recaptcha">
# container. There is no `data-sitekey`, no inline `grecaptcha.execute(...)`,
# and no `grecaptcha.render` anywhere in the served HTML — all four things
# detect_recaptcha_v3() keys off are absent. It returns None on this page
# even though a real reCAPTCHA is present and active.
#
# The sitekey is still recoverable, but only at runtime, from two places
# that exist in the live page and not in its HTML:
#   1. window.___grecaptcha_cfg.clients — the reCAPTCHA API's own client
#      registry. Property names inside it are minified and change between
#      releases, so this walks the object looking for a value shaped like a
#      sitekey (^6L[\w-]{30,}$) rather than trusting any key name.
#   2. the reCAPTCHA iframe's `k=` query parameter — a stable, documented
#      part of the widget's URL, used as a cross-check and fallback.
#
# The same client config also carries `size`, which is what tells v3 apart
# from v2-invisible. That distinction is not cosmetic: 2captcha needs
# `version=v3` + `action` + `min_score` for one and `invisible=1` for the
# other, and sending the wrong one burns balance for a token that won't
# validate.

# What is deliberately NOT here
# ===========================================================================
# The sibling repo in this family carries a whole second solver for its
# site's OWN first-party image captcha ("Enter the characters you see below",
# a JPEG of distorted text and a GET form). Roughly 190 lines of it, and none
# of it is ported here, because BBB has no such page.
#
# What BBB does instead is refuse in two shapes, and only ONE of them is
# something a solver can answer. Measured 2026-09-16:
#
#   "Just a moment..."          a Cloudflare Managed Challenge, ~15 KB, with
#                               `cf_chl_opt`, `__cf_chl` and a Turnstile
#                               widget on it. This IS a test, and it is what
#                               the machinery below is for.
#   "You have been blocked |    a refusal, ~12.5 KB, with no widget, no
#    Better Business Bureau(R)"  sitekey and no challenge of any kind. There
#                               is nothing for a solver to answer.
#
# Both answer HTTP 403 and both wear BBB's own branding in the title, so they
# are told apart structurally rather than by the title —
# product_parser.detect_page_state reports the first as "challenge" and the
# second as "blocked", and page_flow.STATE_POLICY spends on the first and
# never on the second. From a datacenter address it is the second that
# arrives, and the answer to it is a different exit rather than a purchase.
#
# The reCAPTCHA / hCaptcha / Turnstile machinery above IS kept, and that is a
# deliberate asymmetry rather than an inconsistency. Detection stays broad
# because which challenge a visitor meets depends on the exit country and on
# what the address has been doing — a narrow list is how a challenge gets
# reported as an empty page months later. A solver for a challenge this site
# has never been observed to serve is dead code; a DETECTOR for one is cheap
# insurance. See the family note in CLAUDE.md.
